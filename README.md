## üìå Task Overview
This repository contains my solution for **Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** using the Titanic dataset. The goal was to prepare raw data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Included
- `titanic_cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with complete code
- `titanic.csv`: Raw dataset (automatically downloaded in notebook)
- `cleaned_titanic.csv`: Processed output file
- `screenshots/`: Visualization outputs (boxplots, heatmaps)

## üîç Key Steps Performed
1. **Data Exploration**: Identified missing values and data types
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted titles from names (Mr/Mrs/Miss)
   - Created family size feature
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled outliers using IQR method
   - Scaled numerical features with `StandardScaler`
4. **Visualization**:
   - Boxplots for outlier detection
   - Correlation heatmap analysis
